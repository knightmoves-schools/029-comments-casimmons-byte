the javascript in the script element
- should contain a single line comment that comments out line 14Â  (total = total - 2;)
- should contain a multi-line comment that comments out lines 16, 17 and 18 (`total = total - 4;`, `total = total - 5;` and `total = total - 6;`)
- should set the result element to 39
